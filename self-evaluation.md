# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I feel pretty confident with the basics we covered today. This formatting is bit different than what I was used to using in Java, but again, the over-arching principles still seem to apply (especially in regards to logical operators, if statements, etc.)

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I was able to complete all the exercises in either my first or second attempt so I don't think that really qualifies as struggling yet. I was able to apply my pre-existing knowledge pretty effectively.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I just need a lot more practice coding in Ruby. Obviously this will come with time, but I will always try to push myself to learn more methods outside of the ones listed in the lectures. I dont think I need to make any major adjustments to my calender yet. 

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Nothing comes to mind at the moment.
